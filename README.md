# Anomaly-Report-Log
The Anomaly Log field allows operators or maintenance personnel to document any irregularities or failures detected in the production line.
It is a multiline, auto-wrapping text box designed to capture detailed observations, including:

Mechanical or electrical malfunctions

Unexpected equipment shutdowns

Sensor or communication errors

Any unusual operational behavior

This information can be automatically forwarded to supervisors or integrated into a central monitoring system, improving response time and traceability. The field supports free-form text input to ensure accurate and comprehensive incident reporting.
